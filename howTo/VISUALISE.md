## User Guide: Visualise Tab

There can be a vast number of interdependencies between ACI resources. This complexity can become overwhelming when attempting to piece everything together. The visualisation tool creates dynamic resource dependency paths in the form of a diagram, enabling users to visualise these intricate connections.

Note: Only resources that contain a dependency are listed.

Start by selecting a resource from the list

Once selected, a resource dependency path map will be generated.

Note: The selected resource is highlighted in green, while its dependents are presented in blue. Zoom in and out to better view the diagram, depending on the number of displayed resources.
